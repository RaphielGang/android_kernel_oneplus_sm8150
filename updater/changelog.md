## Sidenote for the benefit of the user:
- I am now shipping boot images for the benefit of those that do not want to root or run TWRP - like those with the OnePlus 7T/Pro.
In order to flash them via fastboot, first ensure that you have the latest platform tools from GOOGLE, and NOWHERE ELSE.
Run the following command:
```fastboot flash --slot all boot <drag and drop boot.img>```
